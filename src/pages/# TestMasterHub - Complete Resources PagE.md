TestMasterHub ‚Äì Project Document
1. Introduction

TestMasterHub is a modern API testing and automation platform designed to simplify and accelerate the software testing process. Unlike traditional tools, TestMasterHub is offline-first, secure, and tailored for QA teams and developers who require a reliable, scalable, and encrypted testing environment.

Currently, TestMasterHub supports REST APIs only, with planned future support for GraphQL, SOAP, and gRPC.

2. Problem Statement

Most existing API testing tools come with one or more of these drawbacks:

Vendor lock-in and cloud dependency (Postman).

Lack of offline encryption & local-first security.

Limited support for data-driven testing.

Missing or expensive test scheduling and automation features.

No smart assertions or AI-driven suggestions to reduce QA effort.

TestMasterHub solves these challenges by offering:

REST API testing with powerful offline-first capabilities.

AES-256 encryption for secure data storage.

Data-driven and automated testing features built-in.

Smart assertion recommendations to minimize manual effort.

Test scheduling and chaining for end-to-end validation.

3. Core Features
üîπ 3.1 API Testing (REST Only ‚Äì Current Support)

Full support for REST API requests.

Organize requests into collections and folders.

Environment management with variables for Dev, QA, Staging, and Prod.

Support for headers, cookies, query params, and authentication flows.

Planned Roadmap: Future support for GraphQL, SOAP, and gRPC.

üîπ 3.2 Smart Assertions

Automatic assertion generation based on previous responses or OpenAPI specs.

Format-aware validations (e.g., email, UUID, non-null, numeric ranges).

Ability to customize assertions and save reusable templates.

üîπ 3.3 Data-Driven Testing

Execute REST requests with dynamic data from CSV/Excel files.

Map file columns directly to request body/params.

Run bulk API validation against multiple datasets.

üîπ 3.4 Request Chaining

Use response values from one request as inputs to the next.

Built-in variable extraction (JSONPath, Regex).

Helps in end-to-end flow validation like login ‚Üí token ‚Üí fetch user details.

üîπ 3.5 Test Scheduling (Monitor)

Run collections at scheduled intervals (daily, weekly, custom cron).

Email or desktop notifications for failures.

Built-in history tracking with execution logs.

üîπ 3.6 Security & Storage

AES-256 encryption for all saved collections, environments, and test data.

Local-first storage with no vendor lock-in.

Optional cloud sync (roadmap) for teams.

üîπ 3.7 Extensibility

Export/import collections in JSON format.

Roadmap for plugin ecosystem for integrations with CI/CD and custom assertions.

4. Technical Architecture

Frontend: React.js (Bootstrap for UI).

Backend: Node.js + Express.js.

Storage: AES-256 encrypted local storage (Keytar integration planned).

Scheduler: Node-based job runner for monitors.

Test Runner: Custom-built execution engine with request chaining and data injection.

6. Roadmap
Q4 2025

Team collaboration with Git integration.

Advanced analytics dashboard for test results.

Export/import to Postman/Bruno formats.

Q1 2026

Plugin ecosystem for custom assertions & integrations.

Enterprise features (SSO, RBAC, audit logs).

Centralized backend for secure, aggregated results (optional, self-hosted).

Future Protocol Support

GraphQL & SOAP (planned for 2026).

gRPC (long-term roadmap).

7. Target Audience

QA Engineers who need secure, automated testing without cloud dependency.

Developers who want lightweight API validation tools.

Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) looking for cost-effective alternatives to Postman Enterprise.

Enterprises that require security-first, encrypted API testing.

8. Conclusion

TestMasterHub is built with the philosophy of security, automation, and flexibility. It bridges the gap between cloud-first tools like Postman and purely offline tools like Bruno by providing the best of both worlds.

Currently, TestMasterHub supports REST APIs only, but its roadmap includes GraphQL, SOAP, and gRPC, making it future-ready for complex enterprise needs.
